# 2025 Advent of Code

## About

This repository contains my solutions to the [2025 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) puzzles.

I did the first two days in Python, then decided it's a good time to learn some Rust. The next 3 days I did in Rust, then I had to prepare for the birth of my second child, so the rest of the days were abandoned.
